# Project Development Summary

This document provides a step-by-step summary of the development process for the project, including explanations of the main files and their purposes.

## 1. Project Structure

- `requirements/`: Contains dependency specifications for the project and testing.
- `app/`: Contains the main application code.
- `tests/`: Contains test files for the application endpoints.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation for the project, including this summary and application instructions.
- `docker-compose.yml` and `dockerfile`: Used for containerization and orchestration.

## 2. Dependency Management

- **Files:** `requirements/base.txt`, `requirements/test-requirements.txt`
- **Purpose:** List the required packages for running and testing the application.

## 3. Application Initialization

- **File:** `app/__init__.py`
- **Purpose:** Defines the `create_app` function, which initializes the application. This function is used to create an app instance for both production and testing environments.

## 4. Route Definitions

- **Files:** `app/routes/health.py`, `app/routes/secret.py`
- **Purpose:** Define the API endpoints for health checks and secret retrieval. 

## 5. Testing Setup

- **File:** `tests/conftest.py`
- **Purpose:**
  - Sets up reusable pytest fixtures for the test suite.
  - The `app` fixture creates an application instance with testing configuration enabled.
  - The `client` fixture provides a test client for simulating HTTP requests to the application.

## 6. Endpoint Tests

- **Files:** `tests/test_health.py`, `tests/test_secret.py`
- **Purpose:** Contain test cases for the application's endpoints, using the fixtures defined in `conftest.py` to ensure isolated and repeatable tests.

## 7. Documentation

- **Files:** `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `SUMMARY.md`
- **Purpose:**
  - `INSTRUCTIONS.md` gives detailed setup, running, and testing steps.
  - `SUMMARY.md` (this file) summarizes the development process and project structure.

## 8. Containerization

- **Files:** `docker-compose.yml`, `dockerfile`
- **Purpose:**
  - `dockerfile` defines the steps to build the application image.
  - `docker-compose.yml` simplifies running the application by defining how to build and run the container.

## 9. Verification Script

- **File:** `verification.sh`
- **Purpose:** Script to verify the setup or deployment of the application, ensuring all components work as expected.

## 10. Continuous Integration

- **File:** `.travis.yml`
- **Purpose:** Defines the Travis CI configuration for automated testing and deployment. When enabled, Travis CI will use this file to test application automatically on each push or pull request, helping ensure code quality. Additionally, A build and deploy process is run on each push or pull request to the master branch, ensuring continuous integration.
